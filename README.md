## ‚ú® Features

LazyHire provides a comprehensive suite of tools centered around efficiency and personalization:

### 1. Application Tracking Dashboard
* **Secure Authentication:** Simple login system configured via environment variables (`.env`).
* **Intuitive Dashboard:** Displays a clear list of all tracked jobs, excluding internal IDs.
* **Visual Status:** Job status is displayed with color-coded badges (New, Applied, Interview Scheduled, Rejected, Offer).
* **Document Status:** Tracks the creation status of personalized documents (`CV Created`, `CL Created`) for quick reference.
* **External Links:** Direct links to the original job advertisement (`Application URL`).

### 2. Personalized Profile & Document Management
* **Detailed Profile Page:** A single source of truth for all professional information (similar to a LinkedIn profile), loaded from a customizable `profile_data.json` file on first launch.
* **Profile Editor:** Allows users to modify and save their detailed profile information (Summary, Skills, Experience, Education).
* **Base CV Generation:** Button to generate a base CV template in Markdown (`.md`) format, stored in the `documents/` directory for manual editing.

### 3. Automated Document Creation & File Management
* **Job Details View:** Dedicated page (`/details/:id`) displaying all contact information and job-specific notes.
* **Dynamic Directory Creation (File System):** When viewing job details, the system automatically creates a dedicated directory for that job: `documents/job-description/[company name]/[job title]/`.
* **AI Document Generation:** Dedicated buttons on the job details page trigger AI generation:
    * **Create Tailored CV:** Uses the Gemini API and profile data to generate a job-specific CV in `.md` format, saved directly to the job's directory.
    * **Create Cover Letter:** Uses the Gemini API to generate a personalized cover letter in `.md` format, saved to the job's directory.
* **Job Deletion:** Functionality to delete an application from the database and remove its associated folder and files from the file system.

### 4. AI Utility Suite
